1. **All ViewSets**:
   - `AssessmentViewSet` - Handles CRUD for assessments
   - `QuestionViewSet` - Handles CRUD for questions
   - `RubricViewSet` - Handles CRUD for rubrics
   - `AssessmentAttachmentViewSet` - Handles file attachments
   - `AssessmentSubmissionViewSet` - Handles student submissions

2. **Custom Actions**:
   - `publish` - Changes assessment status to published
   - `activate` - Changes assessment status to active
   - `statistics` - Provides assessment statistics
   - `submit` - Submits a student's work
   - `grade` - Manually grades a submission
   - `auto_grade` - Automatically grades quizzes

3. **Permission Handling**:
   - Admins (`is_staff` or `is_superuser`) can perform all actions
   - Instructors can perform actions for their courses
   - Students can only submit and view their own work

4. **Complete Business Logic**:
   - Attempt limiting
   - Due date enforcement
   - Status transitions
   - Auto-grading for quizzes
   - Comprehensive statistics

5. **Tracking Fields**:
   - `created_by` and `edited_by` are properly set
   - Timestamps for all actions
   - IP and user agent tracking for submissions

This implementation provides a complete assessment system with full admin access while maintaining proper security and permissions for all user types
